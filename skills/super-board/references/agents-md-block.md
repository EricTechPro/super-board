## Super Board

Board pipeline: Ready → Building → QA → Review → Done. Blocked, Skipped = exits.

| When | Use | NEVER |
|---|---|---|
| Set up / repair the board | `/super-board onboard` | DON'T hand-edit config mid-run |
| Check tickets before a run | `/super-board lint` | NEVER run with AC-less tickets |
| Drain the board | `/super-board run` | NEVER build, test or merge from the orchestrator |
| Board state / halt | `/super-board status` · `/super-board stop` | |
| Build one ticket | `/super-build` | NEVER build outside the card's worktree |
| QA a branch or URL | `/super-qa` | NEVER mark QA pass without evidence |
| Review a PR, merge | `/super-review` | NEVER `gh pr merge` direct — merge gate only |
| File bugs from Sentry, PostHog, PRs | `/super-collect` | DON'T file without a verifier pass |
| UI polish | `/ui-refine-loop` (human runs it) | board NEVER runs it |
| Diagram / explainer page | `/visual` | |

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Config | `.claude/super-board/configs/<slug>.json` |
| Isolation | 1 card · 1 worktree · 1 branch |
| Merge | auto for normal changes · money, auth, destructive schema → human |
| Migrations | robot migrates allowed DBs only · live DB → 🙋 needs you |
| Blocked card | block-template comment · last line `blocked-by:` · 🙋 = needs you |
| Secrets | NEVER read `.env`; key names via `.claude/bin/super-board-env-check.sh` |
| Commits | `type(scope): summary` · imperative · ≤72 chars |
| Comments | outcome first · evidence · `Next:` owner · ≤12 lines |
| Tickets | format → `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` § Ticket format |
